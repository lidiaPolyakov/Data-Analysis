We will begin our journey using the raw data set. We will eventually manipulate the data set and
create a ready data set.
Describe your dataset & features before processing it:
Our data set describes the features surrounding memes. Our goal is to predict the percentages of
views on each memes:

● numerical features: views, videos, photos, comments
● categorical feature: name, status, type, origin_year, origin_price



**These are some of the goals of this Data Analysis:**


Describe the process of cleansing, fixing, prepping the dataset:

Find interesting correlations between features, explain these correlations and prove your claims using plots:

Describe distribution of interesting features and what can be learned about them histogram that describes the distribution for each interesting feature: 

Describe your dataset & features after processing it We used a pair plot to visualize the relationships between features. After processing and analyzing the dataset, we discovered that the “views” feature has the strongest relationship with the videos, status, photos, and comments features

Find the best features that influence the class column. Describe your process of finding them
Calculate correlation coefficient and the scatter plot by selecting the features with a strong linear relationship with the target column 'views'.

Classification We used 2 classifier models to ensure our accuracy result was correct because the accuracy result was close to 0, meaning our prediction was inadequate. We used Gaussian naive bayes and a decision tree to ensure our first model is not defective.
